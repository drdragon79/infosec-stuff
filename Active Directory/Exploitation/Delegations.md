- Commonly knows as ACL based attacks.
- Some frequently misconfigured ACEs are:
	- `ForceChangePassword`: Ability to set user's current password without knowin current password.
	- `AddMembers`: Ability to add users, groups to target group.
	- `GenericAll`: Complete controll over object, including changing password, register SPN, or adding objects to user groups.
	- `GenericWrite`: Ability to update any non-protected parameters of our target object. For example, update `ScriptPath` parameter, which is the script that runs every time the user logs in.
	- `WriteOwner`: Ability to update the owner of the target, making ourselves the owner of the target, allowing us to gain additional control over the target
	- `WriteDACL`: Ability to write additional ACEs to the target object's DACL. For example, we can add additional ACEs to our user that grants our account full control over the target object
	- `AllExtendedRights`: Ability to perform any action associated with the extended AD rights against the target host.

These ACE misconfiguration can be easily identified by Bloodhound/Sharphound.
These ACE misconfiguration can be abused by PowerSploit or with AD-RSAT module in powershell.
